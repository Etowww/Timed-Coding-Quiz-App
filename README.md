# Timed-Coding-Quiz-App

## Description
This app is designed to test the user's knowledge on a variety of different coding related questions. The test is timed and contains high scores that allow users to gauge their progress. This app is especially useful for people who want to study coding principles they might not be completely familiar with.

The quiz will then begin, starting with a prompt and four possible answers underneath the prompt. The quiz will not allow you to move forward to the next question until the correct answer has been selected. Any incorrect choices will deduct 10 seconds from your time remaining and ultimately effect your score. Once the timer reaches 0 seconds or you have run out of questions to answer you will be directed to enter your name into an input field. You can submit your name and score to the highscores page by pressing the submit button.

Once your hiscore has been saved you will be directed to view the highscores page by pressing the view hiscores button. Once there you will see a list containing all of your local hiscores. (Pictured Below).

## How to Contribute

There are many things that still need to be contributed to this project. Of primary concern is the CSS stylings, it is about as bare bones as can get so any styling would greatly improve the appearance of this application.

It currently only has two questions but a plethora of questions could be added to this quiz.

It currently has no way to sort the hiscores list, developing a function to do that would make the list more visually appealling.

The app will take 10 seconds away from your remaining time/score if you answer a question incorrectly, however this change is not apparent and I would like to add a visible feedback event that displays more apparently wether or not the user has chosen the correct answer.
